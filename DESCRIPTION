Title: Genome-Wide Peak Calling Using PeakSegFPOP and PeakSegJoint
Version: 2019.9.28
Author: Toby Dylan Hocking
Maintainer: Toby Dylan Hocking <toby.hocking@r-project.org>
Description: Implementations of supervised machine learning
 algorithms for peak detection in ChIP-seq data.
 PeakSegFPOP <arXiv:1810.00117> for single-sample peak calling
 (independantly for each sample and genomic problem).
 PeakSegJoint <arXiv:1506.01286>
 for joint peak calling (for each peak, jointly using all samples).
